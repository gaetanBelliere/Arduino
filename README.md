Repo for Arduino personnal projects

# First project : Gaet'A'Led
This project is based on a LED strip to lighten up the living room. It will be possible to control it from a
smartphone thanks to a wifi module (Wemos D1 mini). I followed this online tutorial to get started : https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-esp8266-rgb-led-strip-web-server/
I then added some options, like the possibility to make the strip blink, it will be great in the christmas tree !

Here is a look at what the web page looks like :
